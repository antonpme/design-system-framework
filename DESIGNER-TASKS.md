## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. Design First, Code Later
Always design in Figma before asking AI to code. AI works best with visual references.

### 2. One Feature at a Time
Don't design everything at once. Design one screen, AI builds it, you test it, move to next.

### 3. Over-Communicate
When something doesn't look right, take a screenshot and show AI what's wrong.

### 4. Test Early and Often
Test each feature as soon as AI builds it. Don't accumulate bugs.

### 5. Write Clear Requirements
The clearer your instructions, the better AI's implementation.

### 6. Iterate
First version doesn't have to be perfect. Refine based on testing.

### 7. Focus on UX
You're the UX expert. If something feels wrong, trust your instincts.

### 8. Celebrate Progress
After each completed feature, celebrate! Building a product is hard work.

## 📞 How to Work with AI

### Starting a Work Session
```
"Hi! I'm ready to work on [feature name].
Here's my Figma design: [link or screenshot]
Here's what it should do: [requirements]
Let's build it!"
```

### Giving Feedback
```
"I tested the color picker. Here's what needs fixing:
1. The color is too small [screenshot]
2. The shades aren't generating [screenshot]
3. The preview isn't updating [video]

Can you fix these?"
```

### Asking for Help
```
"I'm not sure how to design the conflict resolution UI.
Can you show me some examples from other apps?
What information should I display to users?"
```
